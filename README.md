# Machine-Learning---Educational-Material
This repository is focused on providing educational material to those who start learning Machine Learning with python. [Many things I learn myself as I provide material for education, therefore the repository is of an altruistic character; have fun learning new things!]

Most of the information is provided in the form of .ipynb files, so you could experiment with information yourself or see specifically what outputs some certain functions provide before they become a part of a big all-in-one function. As well, such files also try to explain as much as possible about the process of building one or another function.

If this helps anyone, I'm more than satisfied!
