# A bit about classes.

So classes is not my favorite topic. And you can usually avoid using them. However, I want to give a short runndown in couple of tutorials/lessons, what classes are, how you can think about them and what's the usage for them. It's something I'm also learning on the spot and I want to give a very easy lesson in how to understand them, because in reality - I found it quite confussing at first.

Hopefully, this series can help you lean a bit about classes. And in the last lesson/tutorial, an example of usinng machine learning approaches will be given.
