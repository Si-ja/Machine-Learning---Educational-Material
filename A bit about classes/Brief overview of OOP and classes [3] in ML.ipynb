    "This file will be a bit different. It will take an idea of classes and implement it in using with Machine Learning functions. Particularly KNN and Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The idea will be to make a class that holds an ability to prepare different models of different categories and produce a log of how well we performed. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will not build any functions from scratch, rather will use the standard scikit-learn package...however this will lead to weird methods application where we will apply a method from scikit-learn library for a ML model, on top of our methods that we will define in our classes. This is because those ML model preparation methodologies are also based on classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "It might not be what you want to prepare in general. However, my idea was that i want to have a class that can work with many ML model training approaches and specifically generate logs for me on that data."
