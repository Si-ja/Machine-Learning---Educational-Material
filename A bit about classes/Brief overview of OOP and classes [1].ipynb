    "This file is dedicated to a short explanation of what classes are and what is OOP...object oriented programing. A short backstory: I used to not like or understand classes, but after getting a grip on them and beginning to understand, I still do not like them.\n",
    "\n",
    "My knowledge of objects started forming only when beginning to learn javascript and reading a lot online about classes in python. Here is a good resource you can refer to additionally: https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/python/object-oriented-programming/classes-and-objects-i/tutorial/\n",
    "\n",
    "Often I noticed objects are not properly disccused which leads to a harder understanding of classes and their practicality. As well, knowelege of them, I believe, would easier point towards the fact that usage of classes, just like functions - it's a tool, not a necessity, as often led to be believed in languages like python.\n",
    "\n",
    "**So what is an object**. Simply put, an object is something that has many features (or several). My best explanation that I can give: a cake. Now a cake is usually made out of components like milk, flour, sugar, water. When you create an object, the idea behind it is to keep that information about the object - what it is made from. Now you can do it the same way by assigning variables. Here is an example:"

Before we come to classes, let me give you a simpler example, that an object can be an equation:"

    "And here where finally classes come in. Often they are refered to as \"blueprints\" for building something over and over, just using differently set variables. Which is a good explanation. But with the example of a cake, I would like to prepose another way of thinking - it's lika a recipe - you can make a cake if you follow a correct recipe, but you always can change your values a bit to get a slightly different cake. Classes are those constructors or recipes that you can reuse every single time and then access them (there is much more to it, but this will give you a general idea).\n",
